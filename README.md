üõ†Ô∏è Task-02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, we perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset (e.g., the Titanic dataset from Kaggle).

Purpose:
The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns or trends that provide deeper insights.

Key Steps in Implementation:

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (imputation or removal).

Remove duplicates and fix inconsistencies.

Convert data types where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate summary statistics.

Visualize distributions (histograms, box plots, etc.).

Explore relationships between variables (scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, group comparisons).

Insights & Trends

Identify key patterns in the data.

Detect outliers and unusual observations.

Highlight relationships that could inform predictions or further analysis.
